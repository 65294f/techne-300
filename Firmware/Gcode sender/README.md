inspired by builds like Chris Borges printed cnc. using thin walled prints with threaded rods and concrete to add weight and sctucture for a budget. 
The Techne-300 is a simple CNC mill primarily made of 3d printed and readily available parts. It is designed for consistent milling for prototyping. with a total cost between 350 and 500 dollars depending on where parts are sourced.

I wanted to make this to help my ftc team quickly prototype parts that would normaly take weeks to make or get. we have tons of innovateive deisgn ideas that are imposible for us to bring into reality without a cnc machine. This build is supposed to be iterated and improved over time for whatever application needed. I wanted to make an intresting machince something that hadnt been made before thats why i went for the movment and the structure that i designed.


<h1 align="center">Design</h1>
This design started on paper just small ideas that compounded into the machine you see now.
