Inspired by builds like Chris Borges printed CNC. Using thin-walled prints with threaded rods and concrete to add weight and structure for a budget. 
The Techne-300 is a simple CNC mill primarily made of 3D printed and readily available parts. It is designed for consistent milling for prototyping, with a total cost between 350 and 500 dollars depending on where parts are sourced.

I wanted to make this to help my FTC team quickly prototype parts that would normally take weeks to make or get. We have tons of innovative design ideas that are impossible for us to bring into reality without a CNC machine. This build is supposed to be iterated and improved over time for whatever application is needed. I wanted to make an interesting machine, something that hadn’t been made before — that’s why I went for the movement and the structure that I designed.

<h1 align="center">Design</h1>
This design started on paper, just small ideas that compounded into the machine you see now.

<h1 align="center">Structure</h1>

The structure was inspired by Chris Borges 3d printed CNC machine. it uses concrete filled thin walled 3d parts to add weight and structure well keeping prices low. to add more structure for the parts 5/16in threaded rod is rand through the thin walled parts and secured with nuts.

</p>

the parts thin walls are connected to prevent spreading from the weight of the concrete. this came after a few iterations of printed prototypes. 
The main structure is made of a single 3dprinted part repeated 14 times with repeated corner pieces to reduce complexity.
